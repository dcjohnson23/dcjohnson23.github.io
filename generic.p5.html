						<h1>Clinical SNP association and GWAS</h1>
							<p><b>Thalidomide related venous thrombosis</b><br>
							Taking a gene list developed together with US and Dutch collaborators, I designed a custom SNP array of 3,400 SNP from an early dbSNP and a number of pathway oriented SNP databases. The array focused on non-synonymous variants and SNP with described functionality.
							We performed a SNP associated with venous thrombosis in a case-control analysis of thalidomide patients, combining the results from three clinical trials. Careful reexamination of the serious adverse reports was required to ensure the 
							appropriate distinction between venous thrombosis and atrial thrombosis which have differing mechanisms, with atrial event not symptomatic of thalidomide-related toxicity. Results from
							the thalidomide-related analysis was contrasted with a non-thalidomide treatment arm. Multiple testing was accounted for by label-swapping permutation. Pairwise epistasis was examined and recursive partitioning analysis was used to build a multi-SNP model for thalidomide related VTE. <br><br>
							Left is diagram show hypothetical model for thalidomide VTE consistent with association results from our study. On the right, is decision tree derived
							from a recursive partitioning analysis of association results from thalidomide related analysis.

							<p><b>Thalidomide related neuropathy</b><br>
							Using the 3,400 custom array again, we undertook an case-control analysis of thalidomide related neuropathy. Treatment dosage, age, pathway, WHO status, toxicity stage and neuropathy status over time of the study
							were used to define thalidomide-related neuropathy status. Associations were reported if they were significantly associated with neuropathy following permutation in both independent studies. We also reported vincrintine-related
							associations. A dutch-led analysis of bortezomib treated patients was also carried out utilising the custom array in Dutch, French and Czech patient samples.<br><br>
							Left is a breakdown of the treatment and study numbers. On the right a bar graph of disease response in myeloma IX cases, and plot of time to thalidomide-related neuropathy by response.

							<p><b>Bone disease</b><br>
							An important serious adverse event in myeloma is bone disease that can be characterised with discrete or diffuse lytic lesion. I spent considerable time synchronising bone disease status,amongst the separate trials with the study. This was complicated by a changes in patient cases report forms between the two UK trials. In addition, across
							the course of the My11 trial there was a move to considering MRI in addition to X-ray bone scans. Finally, the majority of myeloma patients are older, so are more susceptible non-treatment related fractures. It was important to use all available demographics to define bone disease between cohort.
							We identified at genome-wide significance, P = 4.09 x 10<sup>-9</sup> a previous described variant in TNFRSF11B/OPG an rankL inhibitor. The variant was described in european non-myeloma bone disease study of 8557 patients at P = 7.6 x 10<sup>-10</sup> published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18455228"> Lancet (2008) </a>, they showed the top variant was a bone eQTL Twin study data. 
							These results were important as they suggested that underlying bone disease in myeloma was mechanistically similar to osteoporosis and that myeloma patients 
							could potentially benefit from therapies targeting OPG/RANK/RANKL pathways such as Denosumab.<br><br>
							On the left is association plot of myeloma bone risk at TNFRSF11B/OPG, triangle points are from imputed SNPs. On the right is a forest plot of the two strongest myeloma bone associations across the four nationwide
							Myeloma trials.

							<p><b>OS/PFS GWAS</b><br>
							I undertook extensive uni-variant analysis of known prognosis factors both clinical and genomic. Treatment, disease stage, population eigenvectors were used as in the German analysis as co-variates, as there was population differences across the German set, Heidelberg patients did better than there northern counter parts. Age was exclusively used as covariant
							in the US analysis, as all German patient were young, and as UK treatment was already stratified for age. Although we had publishable results, this study design led to us measuring general survival factors associated with outcome, rather tumour specific factors. I might suggest that single treatment studies may provide more fruitful results.
							I also used ISS as a proxy to account for the more deleterious chromosomal lesions, which I believe was suboptimal. <br><br>
							On the left, is a association plot of the meta-analysis results for overall survival across 6q25. On the right, Kaplan-meier curves for each individual trial within the study for the sentinel SNP at 6q25.
